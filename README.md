# Sas-employee-project

During this university project, I utilized SAS software to analyze three datasets containing information about company employees. Through data processing, I generated detailed reports examining key information such as departmental structure, job roles, and donations made throughout the year. The thorough analysis of these datasets provided a comprehensive overview and valuable insights into the corporate environment.
